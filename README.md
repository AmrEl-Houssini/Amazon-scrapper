# amazon-scrapper
When it comes to scraping, for me, unleashing data from the HTML structure is a very fun and I believe it's crucial task for businesses. 
As someone who learns best by doing and applying new information in a project in parallel, I found it extremely fun to convert my ideas into a script. 
So, I made one to scrape data from Amazon's website based on a search query which I gave to the script, 
and then generated CSV file to hold the data.

But I didn't stop there. I wanted to take it to the next level 
so I started thinking about how I could leverage models like chatgpt to process the data even further. 
That's when I came up with the idea to use the Lang Chain framework, which is a framework for developing applications powered by language models using OpenAI API key. 
I built a script using the framework that made use of an "agent" to think and make decisions on its own to achieve the goal I gave it.
